# Joao Angular Calendar App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

It creates a day calendar app, with no blocks overlapping any other, with given inputs in object format, such as: [ {start: 30, end: 150}, {start: 540, end: 600}, {start: 560, end: 620}, {start: 610, end: 670} ];

## Development server

Run `npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular`.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
